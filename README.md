## Introduction

Primer Shell is a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline the initialization process of Node.js applications, using carefully crafted templates for optimal project structuring.

## Quick start

Prior to proceeding, ensure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) is installed on your system. It is further recommended to utilize [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) as your package manager and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as your integrated development environment for an optimized development experience.

To get started, simply run this command in your command prompt:

```bash
npx primer-shell
```
